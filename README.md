# Bike Share Data

## Description

Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This app uses data provided by Motivate, a bike-share system provider for three major cities in the United States (Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC), and allows users to **learn about bike-share use** by computing a variety of descriptive statistics .
